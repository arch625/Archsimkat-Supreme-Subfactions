# Archsimkat-Supreme-Subfactions
A small number of significant changes to the base Supcom factions to create 8 new subfactions with varied, interesting, and distinct playstyles that will coexist alongside the base factions.

Principles
1. Balance changes are focused on competitive 1v1, TMM, and tournament games and maps; not
casual games and mapssuch as Dual Gap or Astro Crater.
2. Subfactions do not replace base factions, but rather co-exist with the base factionsfor a total of
12 playable factions.
3. The subfactions will alwaysfollow the base factionâ€™sidentity and ideology.
4. All the subfactions and base factionsshould have approximately overall equal power level, but
not necessarily have equal power level on a specific map.
5. Unless otherwise stated, balance for the base factions will not diverge from regular faf balance,
and any changes applied to faf balance will carry forward and be applied to the mod unless
otherwise stated.
